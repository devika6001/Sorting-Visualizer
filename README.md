### Here is the live preview for this project : https://sorting-algo-visualizer-5.netlify.app/

This project basically takes an array and has 5 algorithms like bubble sort, quick sort, insertion sort, selection sort and merge sort. We can choose either of the sorting algorithm and can see it getting sorted. This is build entirely using React.js.
